# Password Generator
A password generator built in java. The main class is located in [`Generator.java`](https://github.com/GrantBGreat/java-password-generator/blob/main/src/Generator.java). All code has also been commented in order to be easly readable.

This program was made in practice for the Grade 11 AP Computer Science (ICS3U-AP) exam. It isn't perfect but it was not meant to be perfect.
